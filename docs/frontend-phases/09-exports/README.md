# Phase 09: Exports

## Overview

This phase implements the export functionality allowing users to download documents and topics in multiple formats (PDF, LaTeX, Markdown). The system handles asynchronous export job processing with progress tracking and download management.

## Goals

- Implement export request flow from document/topic pages
- Support multiple export formats (PDF, LaTeX, Markdown)
- Build export job status tracking with polling
- Handle download completion and error states
- Implement export history (optional)
- Support batch exports for large documents

## Deliverables

1. **Export Components**
   - `ExportTrigger` - Button/dropdown to initiate export
   - `ExportModal` - Format selection and options
   - `ExportStatusIndicator` - Progress/status display
   - `DownloadButton` - Download completed exports

2. **Pages**
   - Export Status Page (`/exports/[jobId]`)
   - Download Management (modal-based)

3. **Features**
   - Format selection (PDF/LaTeX/Markdown)
   - Quality settings for PDF
   - Progress polling
   - Auto-download on completion
   - Error recovery

## Dependencies

**Completed Before This Phase:**
- Phase 01: Foundation
- Phase 02: App Shell
- Phase 05: Topic Detail
- Phase 06: Document Viewer

**Required APIs:**
- `POST /api/v1/exports` - Create export job
- `GET /api/v1/exports/:jobId` - Get job status
- `GET /api/v1/exports/:jobId/download` - Download file
- `DELETE /api/v1/exports/:jobId` - Cancel job

## Exit Criteria

✓ All acceptance criteria pass
✓ Export flow works end-to-end
✓ Multiple formats supported
✓ Progress tracking functional
✓ Downloads complete successfully

## Estimated Effort

**Complexity:** Medium (M)
**Estimated Time:** 3-4 days
**Risk Level:** Medium (async processing, file handling)
